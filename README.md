# password-generator

## Description:
**The challenge this week was to modify the starter code of an application to create a Random Password Generator (RPG).  With the HTML and CSS already started, the main goal was to write the JavaScript code to make the RPG function correctly.

## Tasks performed:

> Building off the starter code, I first created the variables for the lowercase and uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters.  I then made the function to generate a series of prompts to be presented to the user, asking what types of characters and how many they would like to have in their password. 

> Once the characters were selected, I created a “for loop” with an if and else statement, essentially randomizing the character types chosen.

> Lastly, I added a few else statements alerting the user their selection was invalid and to try again using the RPG parameters.  Once the RPG was working correctly, I cleaned up my JavaScript and added comments to the code.
